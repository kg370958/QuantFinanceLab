# # Finance Quantitative Research Project

Welcome to the Finance Quantitative Research Project repository! This repository contains code and analysis for various quantitative finance projects, including Bootstrap project, Portfolio Optimization using Monte Carlo and Markowitz theory, and Hypothesis Testing on the Titanic dataset.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Bootstrap Project
Description: This project explores the application of bootstrap resampling technique in finance. Bootstrap is used to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic by resampling with replacement from the original data.

### 2. Portfolio Optimization with Monte Carlo and Markowitz Theory
Description: This project implements portfolio optimization techniques using Monte Carlo simulation and Markowitz theory. It considers both short-selling and no short-selling constraints to construct optimal portfolios with desired risk-return profiles.

### 3. Hypothesis Testing on Titanic Dataset
Description: This project focuses on hypothesis testing using various statistical methods on the Titanic dataset. It includes Pearson's Chi-Square test for independence in logistic regression, Shapiro-Wilk test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and Fisher's exact test. These tests are utilized to analyze the relationships between variables and identify significant predictors of survival on the Titanic.
